# numpy-ml
Ever wish you had an inefficient but somewhat legible collection of machine
learning algorithms implemented exclusively in numpy? No? 

## Documentation
To see all of the available models, take a look at the [project documentation](https://numpy-ml.readthedocs.io/) or see [here](https://github.com/ddbourgin/numpy-ml/blob/master/numpy_ml/README.md).

## Contributing

Am I missing your favorite model? Is there something that could be cleaner /
less confusing? Did I mess something up? Submit a PR! The only requirement is
that your models are written with just the [Python standard
library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/). The
[SciPy library](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/) is also permitted under special
circumstances ;)
